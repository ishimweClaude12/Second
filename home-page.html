    <h1>My History</h1>
    <h2>this is my story</h2>
    <p>I was born in 'em trenches. I went primay in brookly but my mother said the kids there have lost controll <br>
    but I said "I will find my own friends there.", what she didn't know though, was that there was a war between gangs. ghetto boys and compton boys were fighting. Guns and knives were their only weapons <br>
    my friend was from such neighbourhoods but we were friends still.

    <h1>My Values or Simply "The Ethics of Ambiguity"</h1>
    <img src="./assets/images/simone.jpeg" alt="Simone de Beauviour" height="360" width="640px">

    <p>In her 1947 book The Ethics of Ambiguity, Simone de Beauvoir outlines an existentialist ethics. She was inspired by Jean-Paul Sartre ’s promise to do so at the end of Being and Nothingness (1943); a project for which he wrote many notes but which he never completed. The Ethics of Ambiguity is one of de Beauvoir’s most intriguing and original philosophical works. But is the theory it contains defensible? And does it give us practical guidance for how to live our lives?

In The Bonds of Freedom (BF), a careful analysis of de Beauvoir’s ethics, Kristana Arp asks whether de Beauvoir’s ethics of ambiguity is actually a form of ethical subjectivism. Arp examines a set of possible existentialist ethical perspectives, particularly those that deal with freedom and values, to try to tell whether or not they can be undermined by this charge. Although Arp sees great value in de Beauvoir ’s ideas on ethics, she says the answer remains somewhat unclear. However, I would like to argue that de Beauvoir’s ethics of ambiguity is definitely not a form of ethical subjectivism. To this end, I’ll begin by outlining the ethics of ambiguity; then I’ll define ethical subjectivism, describe Arp’s position, and finally explain why I don’t think de Beauvoir’s ethics fall to this charge of subjectivism.</p>
